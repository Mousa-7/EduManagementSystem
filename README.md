# Education Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Education Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage students, instructors, courses, and enrollments efficiently.  
The project integrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with relational database design using SQL Server.

This system was developed as a **practical project for the OOP and Database Systems courses**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **GUI:** Java Swing  
- **Database:** SQL Server  
- **Database Access:** JDBC  
- **IDE:** NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Database Tool:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

---

## 👥 User Roles
The system supports multiple user roles:
- **Admin**
  - Manage users (students & instructors)
  - Manage courses
- **Instructor**
  - View assigned courses
  - Manage students enrolled in courses
- **Student**
  - View available courses
  - Enroll and unenroll from courses

---

## ⚙️ Main Features
- User authentication (Login system)
- CRUD operations for:
  - Users
  - Students
  - Instructors
  - Courses
  - Enrollments
- Real-time database interaction using JDBC
- Input validation and error handling
- Role-based system behavior
- SQL queries with joins between multiple tables

---

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Applied
- **Encapsulation:** Private attributes with getters and setters
- **Inheritance:** User class as a parent of Student, Instructor, and Admin
- **Polymorphism:** Method overriding and parent references
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces
- **Exception Handling**
- **Collections Framework**

---

## 🗄️ Database Design
- Relational database designed using ERD
- Proper use of:
  - Primary Keys
  - Foreign Keys
  - Constraints
- SQL Scripts included for:
  - Database creation (DDL)
  - Sample data insertion (DML)

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the project in NetBeans or IntelliJ
2. Import the SQL scripts into SQL Server using SSMS
3. Update database connection settings in `DBConnection.java`
4. Run the main application class
5. Login using sample credentials from the database
